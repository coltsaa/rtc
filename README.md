# WebRTC
*this is my simple demo about WebRTC.*  
_i format the code and it now seems pretty._

main.js provides a API *getUserMedia()*

~`update 1` : capture button added , now you can take screenshot .~

~`update 1.2` : what\`s more , 4 kinds of image effect added .~

`update 2` : RTC peer connection added . As a simple RTC application , it worked , even you could line with yourself .
